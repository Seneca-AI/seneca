Requirements:
* [Exiftool](https://exiftool.org/install.html#Unix) must be installed on the server for the datagatherer server to work
* There are many setup steps, like downloading go requirements and generating protobuf files, that are not yet documented here.  They will soon be automated in a Makefile.
